<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone, I'm Febry Orlando Purba, and 
  I'm currently diving headfirst into the 
  world of web development. I'm a complete 
  newbie, but I'm absolutely loving the process of learning HTML, 
  CSS, and JavaScript. I'm fascinated by how these languages come 
  together to create the websites and applications we use every day.</p>

<p>Although I don't have any formal experience yet, 
  I'm a fast learner and I'm eager to absorb as much knowledge as 
  possible. I'm constantly experimenting with code, building small 
  projects, and challenging myself to learn new concepts. I'm particularly 
  interested in front-end design, interactive elements, and responsive layouts.</p>

<p>I'm excited to connect with other developers and learn from their 
  experiences. I'm a firm believer that the best way to grow is to 
  surround yourself with people who are passionate about the same things 
  you are. So, if you're a fellow web developer or just someone who's 
  interested in tech, I'd love to chat and exchange ideas!</p>
